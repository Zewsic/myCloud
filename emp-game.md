# The game "Empress: The Cult of Freedom"

## General concept

"Empress: Cult of Freedom" is a text quest with elements of mini-games and RPG mechanics, immersing the player in a dark world where the gaming industry is controlled by the ruthless corporation **DENUVO**, and players find themselves victims of cruel DRM systems. Empress is a cult hacker who gathers a team of like-minded people to destroy DENUVO, free players and, of course, expand the influence of their own cult. The Empress cult gathers not just hackers, but personalities united by a passion for music, philosophy and freedom. This is a space where there are no boundaries, and where everyone can be themselves.

## Genre and style

- **Genre**: Text quest with RPG elements, puzzles and mini-games.
- **Style**: Hacker retro-futurism, a combination of the digital world with philosophical themes. A technological design inspired by old hacker movies and cyberpunk.
- **Platform**: PC and mobile devices.

## Advanced Mechanics

### 1. **Cult Management**
   - **Description**: The Empress cult is not just a collection of hackers, it is a philosophical movement united by the love of freedom and art. The player will have to develop a cult by attracting new members, choosing the direction of their training and interacting with cult members. Each member of the cult has their own unique skills and approaches.
   - **Example**: The player decides what the cult members will learn next week — the philosophy of the ancients, playing the piano or discussing movies. These choices influence how the cult can help in future operations against DENUVO.

###  2. **Piano Duels**
   - **Description**: Music is an important part of the Empress cult, and important negotiations and decisions are often accompanied by musical duels on the piano. The player must participate in a mini-game where it is necessary to press the keys (QTE) in time or solve musical puzzles to show their superiority.
   - **Example**: After meeting with a competitor in the hacker community, Empress can offer a piano duel. Winning will give you an advantage in negotiations or the enemy system.

### 3. **Philosophical debate**
   - **Description**: Empress teaches her followers the philosophy of freedom, and the player can participate in philosophical debates with both NPCs and within the cult. This is a puzzle game where you need to choose the right arguments and reflections based on the context of the situation.
   - **Example**: During the mission, Empress enters into a dialogue with DENUVO representatives. The player needs to choose philosophical arguments that will undermine the opponent's confidence and distract him while the hacker team completes the task.

### 4. **Ethical dilemmas**
   - **Description**: With the development of the cult and the strengthening of the influence of Empress, the player is faced with difficult moral choices. Such dilemmas may relate to the introduction of new hacking methods, cooperation with dangerous hacker groups, or deciding whether to distribute classified information.
   - **Example**: The player can choose: hack the DENUVO database and publish personal information of employees or limit himself to destroying their DRM system. These decisions affect the reputation of Empress and cultivate different directions of its ideology.

### 5. **Storming the DENUVO servers**
   - **Description**: At the end of each key task, the player will have to carry out a hacker assault on the DENUVO servers. This is a multi-layered mini-game where the player plans an attack, selects vulnerabilities, cracks passwords and overcomes security systems.
   - **Example**: In one mission, the player must coordinate the actions of several hackers, solving puzzles for each server and avoiding DENUVO traps such as traps, monitoring or fake vulnerabilities.

### 6. **Follower Loyalty System**
   - **Description**: There are various personalities in the Empress cult, such as **Tidus**, **Bex**, **Bet**, **Zew**, **Thailand Girl** and others. Each of them has their own personal history, skills and attitudes towards Empress. The player can interact with them, which affects their loyalty and effectiveness in tasks.
   - **Example**: If Tidus' loyalty decreases, he may start questioning Empress' actions or sabotaging assignments. The level of loyalty can be maintained through face-to-face conversations, performing special tasks, or helping with their personal problems.

### 7. **Chaotic hacks**
   - **Description**: In the later stages of the game, Empress begins to use chaos in her attacks. The player can choose risky hacking methods that can either give a big win or lead to catastrophic consequences.
   - **Example**: In one mission, several DENUVO servers can be hacked at once, but this method leads to increased activity of the enemy security system. Success can allow you to hack the corporate network completely, and failure can leave traces and attract the attention of DENUVO agents.

### 8. **Cult Functionality**
   - **Description**: The cult of Empress develops during the game. The player can upgrade the cult headquarters, add new educational programs, train followers, and set up an internal security system.
   - **Example**: The player decides which areas to invest resources in — you can upgrade the participants' music and philosophy skills or improve their hacking skills. It depends on how effectively the cult will support Empress in its operations.

###  9. **Cultural events**
   - **Description**: An important part of the culture of the cult is joint film screenings and musical evenings, which help to raise the spirits of the participants and inspire them to new feats. These events also affect the motivation of followers.
   - **Example**: The player can choose which movie to watch with the cult members. The chosen film determines which philosophical or emotional topics will be discussed at the next meeting.

## Plot

###  The main idea
The player controls Empress, a hacker who sets herself the task of destroying DENUVO, a company that enforces strict protection systems and DRM in games, depriving users of freedom. As Empress encounters DENUVO, she creates her own cult, which attracts unique personalities.
